Unfortunately everybody else has the same idea, and this often results in crowded beaches and resorts. In The Gambia, it isn’t unusual to have the beach almost exclusively to yourself. And given that the country enjoys year-round sunshine, there’s no need to wait until the peak months to get your fill of sand, sun and sea.
